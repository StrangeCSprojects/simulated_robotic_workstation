# Simulated Robotic Workstation

This project simulates a robotic workstation capable of detecting tools on a workspace and planning motion to grasp them using inverse kinematics. It includes a command-line interface and a simple Flask dashboard for interactive control and monitoring.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Tool detection using OpenCV contour analysis
- 2-link arm simulation with inverse kinematics
- CLI interface for detection and motion control
- Flask web interface for browser-based monitoring
- Event logging to track robot behavior

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Flask
- Matplotlib

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Command Line
```bash
python main.py
```

### Flask Web Dashboard
```bash
export FLASK_APP=infrastructure/dashboard.py
flask run
```
Visit: `http://localhost:5000`

## ðŸ§  Author Notes

This project was developed to simulate the core functionality of a workstation similar to those built at Altitude AI, focusing on perception, motion planning, and system interaction.
